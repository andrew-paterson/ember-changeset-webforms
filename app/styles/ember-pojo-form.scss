// TODO
// GLARING BUG - THE ACTION IN YOUR COMPONENT AFTER YOU UPDATE A CHECKBOX FOR EG DOES NOT EXISTS, ONLY "AFTERVALIDATION"

// Test that fieldClass gets added.
// Test new features for hidden and text separator.
// Docs- array or comma separated list can be passed to checkbox group as defaults.
// Implement array of comma separated list as default for radio button group.
// Implement warning thrown if a default in the array of list for checkbox group or radio button group does not correspond to one of the keys.
// Test for not required but other validation rule present and field empty.
// Horizontal layout for checkbox and radio- no margin-bottom.
// Better names of actions for fields when user interacts. after validation, after validation success and failure
// If you generate the formObject outside the component, resetAfterSubmit throws an error- formSchema must have a formName property,

// Custom validations must be saved somewhere and run in the validate-field util, otherwise you have to remember to call the afterValidation function in the customValidations action.

// afterKeyUpAction(value, event, formField) { becomes afterKeyUpAction(formField, event) {

  // AfterValidation implemented after custom validation is called as well - que: what is custom validation involves async operation?

  // All actions sent from validating-form-field must only use formField as the argument.
// Docs for use of includeLabelOnSubmit
// Test that hidden fields not included in data, not ignored by validator and ignored by check all fields validated.

// BUG Single checkbox must have fieldLabel not label

// DONE
// Changed this.focusOutAction(formField.get('fieldId'), value); to this.focusOutAction(formField);
// Changed this.focusInAction(formField.get('fieldId'), value); to this.focusInAction(formField);
