# Test helpers

## `wasValidated`

Determines whether or not a field has been validated, by checking if the expected UI conditions for a valid or invalid field are present.

First, import ther helper.

```javascript
import { wasValidated } from 'ember-changeset-webforms/test-support/helpers';
```

The `wasValidated` helper receives two arguments

- `identifier` 
  - **Required** 
  - The `identifier` argument can either be the selector of a form field in the DOM, or the DOM element itself.
- `opts`
  -  **Required**
  - The function needs to know what values to check for each condition, and which elements should have them. Thus we pass it an options hash as the second argument. The available props are shown in **"Example opts hash"** below.

<DocsSnippet @name="validation-test-helpers-defaults.js" @title="Example opts hash" />

**Example usage** 

<DocsSnippet @name="was-validated-test-helper-usage.js" @title="Example usage of the wasValidated test helper" />

## `allValidated`

Determines whether or not all the fields in a set have been validated, by checking if the expected UI conditions for a valid or invalid field are present for each one.

First, import the helper. 

```javascript
// Import
import { allValidated } from 'ember-changeset-webforms/test-support/helpers';
```

The `allValidated` helper receives three arguments

- `identifier` 
  - **Required** 
  - The `identifier` argument can either be the selector of a set or form fields or cloned fields in the DOM, or the DOM elements themselves.
- `opts`
  -  **Required**
  - The function needs to know what values to check for each condition, and which elements should have them. Thus we pass it an options hash as the second argument. The available props are shown in **"Example opts hash"** below.
- `indexes`
  - **Optional**
  - the indexes from the set of elements to check. If not passed, all elements in the set will be checked.

<DocsSnippet @name="validation-test-helpers-defaults.js" @title="Example opts hash" />

**Example usage** 

This example checks that the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th and 6th elements in the set returned by the selector `${testEls.clonableFieldWithData} ${els.cwfCloneWrapper}` have all been validated.

<DocsSnippet @name="all-validated-test-helper-usage.js" @title="Example usage of the allvalidated test helper" />

## `noneValidated`

Determines whether or not all the fields in a set have not been validated, by checking that the expected UI conditions for a valid or invalid field are not present for each one.

First, import the helper. 

```javascript
// Import
import { noneValidated } from 'ember-changeset-webforms/test-support/helpers';
```

The `noneValidated` helper receives three arguments

- `identifier` 
  - **Required** 
  - The `identifier` argument can either be the selector of a set or form fields or cloned fields in the DOM, or the DOM elements themselves.
- `opts`
  -  **Required**
  - The function needs to know what values to check for each condition, and which elements should have them. Thus we pass it an options hash as the second argument. The available props are shown in **"Example opts hash"** below.
- `indexes`
  - **Optional**
  - the indexes from the set of elements to check. If not passed, all elements in the set will be checked.

<DocsSnippet @name="validation-test-helpers-defaults.js" @title="Example opts hash" />

**Example usage** 

This example checks that the 1st and second elements in the set returned by the selector `${testEls.clonableFieldBasics} ${els.cwfCloneWrapper}` have all been validated.

<DocsSnippet @name="none-validated-test-helper-usage.js" @title="Example usage of the noneValidated test helper" />

## `passedValidation`

Returns `true` if the field UI satisfies the conditions for a field which has passed validation. The conditions checked are:

- the field element does not contain any error messages,
- the field elements which should have the validation class names have the class names for a valid field,
- the field elements which should have the validation class names do not have the class names for an invalid field,
- the field elements which should have the border colour for a valid element (if any) do have that border colour,
- the field elements which should have the background colour for a valid element (if any) do have that border colour,
- the field element which should have background image property of a valid field (if any) does have it.

The function needs to know what values to check for each condition, adn which elements should have them. Thus we pass it an options hash as the third argument. The availablke props are shown in the example below. 

<DocsSnippet @name="validation-test-helpers-defaults.js" @title="Example opts hash" />

Note that the above options work with the addon defaults, which are based on Bootstrap styling. 
 
Note that `validBorderColour`, `invalidBorderColour`, `validBackgroundColour`, `invalidBackgroundColour`, `validBackgroundImage`, and `invalidBackgroundImage` are not required. If absent, they will not be checked.

The `passedValidation` helper received four arguments

- `identifier` 
  - **Required** 
  - The `identifier` argument can either be the selector of a form field in the DOM, or the DOM element itself.
- `opts`
  -  **Required**
  - See **Example opts hash** above
- `assert`
  - **Optional**
  - The assert funciton from the test function. If present, the function will create an assertion for each check.
- `assertionSuffix`
  - **Optional**
  - Only relevant if the assert argument is included. A string to append to the end of the assertions created.

First, import the helper. In this example, we also import the default options hash to pass as the second argument. In practice these options can be defined anywhere.

```javascript
import { passedValidation } from 'ember-changeset-webforms/test-support/helpers';
import validationTestHelpersDefaults from 'ember-changeset-webforms/test-support/validation-test-helpers-defaults';

```

<DocsSnippet @name="passed-validation-helper-with-assert.js"  @title="Usage which creates an assertion for each check" />

- the field elements which should have the validation class names have the class names for an invalid field,
- the field elements which should have the validation class names do not have the class names for a valid field,
- the field elements which should have the border colour for an invalid element (if any) do have that border colour,
- the field elements which should have the background colour for an invalid element (if any) do have that border colour,
